# LangGraph AI Agent Orchestration Developer Manual
## Part 2: Implementation Details & Agent Design

### Agent Implementation Patterns

#### The Agent Node Pattern

Each agent follows a consistent implementation pattern:

1. **Input Processing**: Extract relevant information from shared state
2. **LLM Interaction**: Use specialized prompts to invoke language models
3. **Output Processing**: Format and structure the response
4. **State Updates**: Return dictionary with state updates

```python
def plan_node(state: AgentState):
    # 1. Input Processing
    messages = [
        SystemMessage(content=PLAN_PROMPT), 
        HumanMessage(content=state['task'])
    ]
    
    # 2. LLM Interaction
    response = model.invoke(messages)
    
    # 3. Output Processing & State Updates
    return {"plan": response.content}
```

This pattern provides:
- **Consistency**: All agents follow the same structure
- **Testability**: Each agent can be tested in isolation
- **Composability**: Agents can be easily combined or reordered

#### Prompt Engineering for Agents

Each agent uses carefully crafted prompts that define their role and constraints:

**Planning Agent Prompt**:
```python
PLAN_PROMPT = """You are an expert writer tasked with writing a high level outline of an essay. 
Write such an outline for the user provided topic. Give an outline of the essay along with any 
relevant notes or instructions for the sections."""
```

**Generation Agent Prompt**:
```python
WRITER_PROMPT = """You are an essay assistant tasked with writing excellent 5-paragraph essays.
Generate the best essay possible for the user's request and the initial outline. 
If the user provides critique, respond with a revised version of your previous attempts. 
Utilize all the information below as needed: 

------

{content}"""
```

Key prompt engineering principles:
- **Role Definition**: Clearly establish the agent's identity and expertise
- **Task Specification**: Precisely define what the agent should produce
- **Context Integration**: Show how to use information from other agents
- **Constraint Setting**: Define quality standards and limitations

#### Research Integration Pattern

The research agents demonstrate how to integrate external data sources:

```python
def research_plan_node(state: AgentState):
    # Generate search queries using structured output
    queries = model.with_structured_output(Queries).invoke([
        SystemMessage(content=RESEARCH_PLAN_PROMPT),
        HumanMessage(content=state['task'])
    ])
    
    # Execute searches and aggregate results
    content = state['content'] or []
    for q in queries.queries:
        response = tavily.search(query=q, max_results=2)
        for r in response['results']:
            content.append(r['content'])
    
    return {"content": content, "queries": queries.queries}
```

This pattern shows:
- **Structured Output**: Using Pydantic models to ensure consistent query generation
- **External API Integration**: Connecting to search services (Tavily)
- **Result Aggregation**: Combining multiple search results
- **State Accumulation**: Adding new content without losing previous research

### Graph Construction and Flow Control

#### Building the Workflow Graph

The graph construction follows a declarative approach:

```python
builder = StateGraph(AgentState)

# Add nodes for each agent
builder.add_node("planner", plan_node)
builder.add_node("generate", generation_node)
builder.add_node("reflect", reflection_node)
builder.add_node("research_plan", research_plan_node)
builder.add_node("research_critique", research_critique_node)

# Define the entry point
builder.set_entry_point("planner")

# Add conditional and fixed edges
builder.add_conditional_edges(
    "generate", 
    should_continue, 
    {END: END, "reflect": "reflect"}
)
builder.add_edge("planner", "research_plan")
builder.add_edge("research_plan", "generate")
builder.add_edge("reflect", "research_critique")
builder.add_edge("research_critique", "generate")
```

#### Edge Types and Their Uses

**Fixed Edges**: Deterministic transitions
- `planner → research_plan`: Always research after planning
- `reflect → research_critique`: Always research after receiving critique

**Conditional Edges**: Dynamic routing based on state
- `generate → END or reflect`: Terminate or continue based on revision count

#### The Revision Loop Architecture

The core innovation is the feedback loop structure:

```
generate → should_continue() → reflect → research_critique → generate
    ↓                              ↑                              ↑
   END ←──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

This creates a natural iterative improvement cycle:
1. Generate initial draft
2. Check if more revisions are needed
3. If yes: get critique, do targeted research, regenerate
4. If no: terminate with final draft

### Memory and Persistence

#### Checkpointing Strategy

LangGraph's `SqliteSaver` provides persistent state management:

```python
memory = SqliteSaver.from_conn_string(":memory:")
graph = builder.compile(checkpointer=memory)
```

Benefits:
- **Resume Capability**: Restart workflows from any checkpoint
- **State History**: Access to all previous states for debugging
- **Branch Exploration**: Try different paths from the same starting point

#### Thread Management

Each workflow instance gets a unique thread ID:

```python
thread = {"configurable": {"thread_id": "1"}}
for s in graph.stream({
    'task': "what is the difference between langchain and langsmith",
    "max_revisions": 2,
    "revision_number": 1,
}, thread):
    print(s)
```

This enables:
- **Concurrent Workflows**: Multiple essay writing sessions
- **Session Isolation**: Each thread maintains independent state
- **Historical Access**: Retrieve any previous workflow

### Error Handling and Robustness

#### Termination Conditions

The system includes multiple safety mechanisms:

```python
def should_continue(state):
    if state["revision_number"] > state["max_revisions"]:
        return END
    return "reflect"
```

- **Revision Limits**: Prevent infinite improvement loops
- **Resource Management**: Control computational costs
- **Quality Gates**: Stop when acceptable quality is reached

#### State Validation

The `TypedDict` approach provides compile-time type checking:
- **Type Safety**: Catch errors before runtime
- **Documentation**: State structure is self-documenting
- **IDE Support**: Better autocomplete and error detection

### Performance Considerations

#### Parallel Execution Opportunities

While this implementation is sequential, the architecture supports parallelization:
- Multiple research queries could run concurrently
- Independent critique dimensions could be evaluated in parallel
- Different draft approaches could be explored simultaneously

#### Resource Management

The system includes several resource control mechanisms:
- **Query Limits**: Research agents are limited to 3 queries maximum
- **Result Limits**: Each search returns maximum 2 results
- **Revision Caps**: Workflows terminate after maximum iterations
